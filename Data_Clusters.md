Data clustering is a way for a program to group similar data on a graph
Consider this image 
![cluster](/temp/cluster.png)

Here our brain tells us that there are three clusters, or three groups, and its safe to assume that the members of these groups have something in common. Therefore if t clusters in a dataset are identified and named. When new data is given, the program can figure out in which cluster it belongs to and approximate its properties based on the properties of that cluster
