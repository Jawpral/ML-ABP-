Pearson correlation coefficient is another effective way of finding similarities between two sets, this method is a commaonly used statistics theorem
Consider A and B who like apples and oranges, A rates oranges 5 and B rates it 8,
Similarly A and b rate apples 8 and 9 respectively
Now, we draw a graph with A and B as axes and plot points apples on (8,9) and oranges on (2,8)\
Imagine now drawing a straight line on the graph, pearson coefficient is basically the slope of the straight line that comes closest to both or all the points on the graph
